# Disney_Hostar_Clone

 Developed a clone of Disney+ Hotstar that involves several components including frontend design (HTML, CSS), backend logic (JavaScript) for handling data and interactions. After successful running of the program we need to Test our app thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. Once satisfied, deploy it to a web server or a hosting service to make it accessible online.
